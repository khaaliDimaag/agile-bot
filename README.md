## scrumMaster

Ever since the Software Engineering course, I am in love with [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and Scrum. This bot helps use the principles of Scrum like product/release/sprint backlog(s), daily progress tracking and burndown charts, and standup and sprint monitoring.

## khaaliReply

This is a simple reply bot used on the server. Made at a [hackathon](https://buhack.org/portal-212/), this version is slightly modified. You can see the (archived) hackathon project [here](https://github.com/palash96rox/bu-bot)

## khaaliStats

A simple stats bot for the khaaliDimaag Server
